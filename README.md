# leetcode-clone
This is a coding platform inspired by LeetCode, built using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It allows users to solve coding problems and run their code in real-time using the Judge0 API. We've also integrated WebSocket for live collaboration and real-time updates. The entire app runs in Docker, making it easy to set up and deploy.
